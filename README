There's two attempts here at rethinking arc (http://arclanguage.org) - and
they're different languages, at different levels of functionality:

1. From the bottom up:
  mzscheme -f yrc.scm
Includes yrc.* and [0-9]*. More experimental.
To run the automated tests:
  yrc> (load "yrc.scm.t")

2. From the top down:
  mzscheme -f as.scm
Includes the remaining, more traditionally arc, files.
